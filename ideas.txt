N-Body Painter? Click/hold mouse to draw, Can place bodies that do different things? then be able to trace and capture?
Be able to draw lines(bodies stacked on top of eachother)? Rows of bodies lined up?


Each ball has its own attributes in a struct (Solid, Color, Movement, Position, velocity)


Questions...
Memory issues with no known # of balls?
    Sol: Dynamically allocated mem?

How to add click & drag fucntions
    Sol: Look @ gl or ask chat

Mason:
1.) Figure out how to place n number of balls in the program
2.)Create the struct storing information about each ball

Later
    Write struct information to a file so we can rerun with the same initial conditions


Leah:
1.) Figure out structure attributes for each ball   
    Current:
        bool isSolid
        float4 Color
        int movement //preconfigured movement pattern
        float4 pos
        float4 vel

Trevor:
    1.) Callback functions:
        If not messing with balls 
            Scroll: Zoom in/out
            Click and drag: Moves simulation
            p: pause
            q: quit
            t: trace  
            v:Orthognal/frustrum view
        Update Terminal
    2.) Create toggles
        defaultView
        draw

Shelby:
    See what we need to do to paint Van Gogh's Starry Night
        Structures to color in
        If any properties of balls need to be added
        It can be super rough, as long as it makes a cool enough painting
