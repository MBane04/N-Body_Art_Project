Step 1:Write the program- COMPLETE


Step 2: The Actual Math Modleing

Left to do:
1.)Figure out what kind of forces/motion we want (Repulsion? How? When?)


Ideas for Methods of painting:
1.) Create walls with balls inside
    a.) Easy but will probably look stupid since we can't get cool patterns with boring walls
2.) Find coordinates of objects
    a.)Can do this by placing balls and writing to positions
        -Would need to keep track of which balls are what structure
    b.)Then use math to make balls travel in circle/line/wave - like patterns until they reach these coordinates
        -Draw the picture w/ coord's, then color it in once we know where everything is
3.) Place balls at certain points and have specific balls attract to the specific ball in a certain manner
    a.) Dr. Wyatt suggested this, but it sounds a bit complicated


Helpful Stuff/ideas:

formula for a circle centered at (h,k) with a radius of r, could use for stars
(x - h)² + (y - k)² = r²

Cos/Sin functions with a long period for waves of sky? Disappear and make other do a spiral once they reach a certain spot?
Can make balls disappear by sending them away with the z-axis

make balls move to give flow to the image
draw outline in one file
